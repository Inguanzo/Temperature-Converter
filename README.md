# Temperature-Converter

The Temperature Converter is an app that allows the user to convert
from Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin to the metric of their choice.  
The app is separated into 2 sections, the top section is the userâ€™s
input where they select an initial temperature value and metric.  In
the bottom section the user selects the metric which they would like
to see their input converted and the app outputs the correct value.
